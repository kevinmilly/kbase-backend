<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<img src="readme-assets/screenshot.PNG" alt="screenshot" width="750" height="400">

Hello Friends and future prospective contributors!  I'm passionate about learning new things and remembering them.  Thus I wanted to make a tool that would help a user
step through the process of learning concepts.  When you think about it usually those steps go like this:

* Idea: You come up with an idea of what you would like to learn.  During this stage you could say you have "Conscious Incompetence".
* Curation: You look for resources to help you learn more.  In my experience, initially, this process is indiscriminate; you take in a variety of sources.  However, eventually you have to sort through your sources to find true resouces you can use to learn the concept.
* Studying/Learning: We learn so quickly from data as we parse it, that this step flows quickly from the previous one.  I think during this step you are not only learning and growing towards "Conscious Compentence" but you are also continuing to audit your resources, filtering out ones that are useless or irrelevant to you at the moment.  Also, learning involves testing our recollection of a concept through subsequent note-taking after a viewing or reading session.  The notes can help us with the short term recording of thoughts and lessons learned.  They can also serve as an anchor for later spaced repetition.
* Advanced Studying: I think moving into more "Unconscious Competence" involves lodging the concepts into your long-term memory.  Regular and strategically placed intervals of study can help with this.  Also, depending on the concept, you can usually find ways to apply what you learned (building an app to test your coding skills, visiting a country to test your language learning, etc.)

This project aims to facilitate the aforementioned process:

* Idea: Record your ideas with the 'Add A Concept Feature'.  From your viewpoint, choose how difficult the subject is; is it an advanced concept?  Also, choose the priority of learning this concept; is it something you have to know or just fun trivia?
* Curation: Currently through the kanban view you, you can drill into a concept by clicking on the "Resources" link.  The resulting modal that pops up will curate sources from Google that may be a helpful resource for learning the concept.  If you would like to look more into a particular result you can drag it into the resource column and save it for the concept.  
* Studying/Learning: This step largely happens outside of the app; using the resources you curated for the concept (or outside resources you can later associate to the concept).  After a learning session, within the app, you can take notes summarizing or detailing what you have learned.  You can categorize the type of note you are taking (random thought, crucial info etc.), helpful for future sorting.
* Advanced Studying: You can track your progress through moving the concept through stages of your competency, as you view it of course.  The sources from Google are tailored  based on what column/stage the concept is at.  For instance, if a concept is in the most advanced stage '1%' then you see sources that focus on applying the knowledge or teaching it to others at an expert level or gaining more information that's 'advanced'.

All in all, there's more work to be done on fleshing this out and of course making the UI and UX more favorable to users.
